# Additional Notes

- Node.js (recommended min: v.16)

- API Endpoint: Since the specific endpoint wasn't provided, I utilized a fake JSON-server to simulate the backend. This allowed me to test the functionality effectively.

- Date Time Questions: Without example data for date-time questions, I implemented a basic date-time input with randomly generated values to ensure functionality.

- Testing Requirement: Due to time limitations, I wasnâ€™t able to implement the testing requirement.
